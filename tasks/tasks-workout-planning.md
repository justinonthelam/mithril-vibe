## Relevant Files

- `src/pages/RoutinePage.tsx` - Main page component for the routine view
- `src/components/Routine.tsx` - Container component for the entire routine
- `src/components/Week.tsx` - Component for a week container
- `src/components/Workout.tsx` - Component for a workout container
- `src/components/Exercise.tsx` - Component for an exercise item
- `src/components/SaveButton.tsx` - Component for the save functionality
- `src/hooks/useSaveState.ts` - Custom hook to manage save state and functionality
- `src/types/routine.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for routine-related data structures
- `src/styles/routine.css` - Styles for the routine components
- `src/utils/dragAndDrop.ts` - Utility functions for drag and drop operations

### Notes
- We'll use a drag and drop library (react-beautiful-dnd) for the drag and drop functionality
- Components will be organized in a hierarchical structure: Routine > Week > Workout > Exercise
- CSS modules or a similar solution should be used for scoped styling
- TypeScript will be used for type safety
