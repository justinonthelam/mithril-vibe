# Product Requirements Document: Workout Planning Feature

## Introduction/Overview
Mithril's workout planning feature enables experienced athletes and personal trainers to create and manage their workout routines through an intuitive, Trello-like interface. The feature focuses on providing a flexible, drag-and-drop experience for organizing workouts across weeks, making it easy to plan and adjust training schedules.

## Goals
1. Create an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for workout planning
2. Enable users to organize workouts in a weekly format
3. Provide a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
4. Implement save functionality via Enter key and save button

## User Stories

- As an athlete, I want to organize my workouts within each week so that I can visualize my training schedule
- As a user, I want to drag and drop components to reorganize my plan so that I can easily adjust my schedule
- As a user, I want to save my changes using a save button or Enter key so that my progress is preserved

## Functional Requirements

2.2. Each week must be displayed as a horizontal row in the routine
2.3. Users must be able to drag and drop weeks to reorder them

### 5. Responsive Design
5.1. The interface must be fully functional on mobile devices
5.2. The layout must adapt appropriately to different screen sizes
5.3. Drag and drop functionality must work on both touch and mouse interfaces

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Exercise details and specifications (sets, reps, weights)
- Workout details beyond basic organization
- Template creation and management
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Progress tracking and statistics
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time/automatic saving of changes

## Design Considerations
- The interface should follow a Trello-like card-based design
- Each component (week, workout, exercise) should have clear visual boundaries
- Drag handles or indicators should be visible to show draggable elements
- The layout should use a responsive grid system that adapts to screen size
- Mobile view may need to adjust the layout to maintain usability on smaller screens
- Save button should be prominently displayed
- Visual indicators should show when there are unsaved changes
- Feedback should be shown when changes are saved successfully

## Technical Considerations
- Implement drag and drop using a reliable library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd)
- Use a state management solution that supports save state tracking
- Implement a save mechanism triggered by Enter key and save button
- Track dirty state to show when there are unsaved changes
- Provide clear success/error feedback for save operations
- Ensure proper touch event handling for mobile devices
- Consider using CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts

## Success Metrics
1. Users can successfully create and organize a complete workout routine
2. The interface remains responsive and functional across different devices
3. Users can successfully save their changes using either the save button or Enter key
4. Users can perform all drag and drop operations intuitively

## Open Questions
1. Should there be a limit to the number of weeks, workouts, or exercises?
2. Should there be a way to collapse/expand weeks or workouts to manage screen space?
3. How should the mobile view handle horizontal scrolling for multiple workouts?
4. Should users be prompted to save changes when navigating away from the page?
5. Should there be a keyboard shortcut for saving besides Enter?
